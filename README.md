OBS Resizer allows you to resize your scenes, nested scenes and their sources with one push of a button.   

This is extremely useful if you decide to switch to a different video resolution or you often create and share your scene collections with other people who  need them for a different resolution.   

If you've ever had to change all your pixel-size perfect scenes to another canvas size, you know how much of a hassle it was and how long it took you to get it all back to perfection. Not anymore, one button does it all!   

As a bonus, the extension should automatically resize your crop and move source filters, so you don't need to worry about manually redoing them! Please note there might be very minor adjustments needed in some cases.   

It comes with a premade deck where you need to change only two values - your scene name and the original width you're resizing it from. After that you can just press the button and let all the magic happen.    

**Important note**   
Although the extension has been thoroughly tested, bugs sometimes happen! I strongly recommend duplicating your scene collection as a backup before using the extension. 

**How to install an extension:**
1. Download the .lbe extension file from **Releases** section (please do not right click and save) 
2. Click on Install Extension in your LioranBoard Receiver
3. Select the extension file you downloaded 
4. Select your default Transmitter you are using. Make 100% sure it is the correct one. 
5. Refresh your Transmitter or close and reopen Lioranboard Receiver.

6. Most extensions include a premade deck with buttons. If you do not see one, create a new button, add "Send to Extensions" command and select the extension you just installed. If you can only see the extension name with no input fields, it means it was not installed correctly. Repeat steps above.
